# Overview

As a Software Engineering student, I do my best to be updated with the technologies often used by companies in the industry. In this Java Snake Game, I recreated the tutorial made by Bro Code on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ) to learn more about Java.

The software that I wrote is a simple game that makes use of classes. It has an event listener for the arrow keys.

The purpose of this software is to learn more about Java and be familiar with IntelliJ IDE.
